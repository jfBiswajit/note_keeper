### The subtle art of not giving a f*ck
- Don’t react on everything. React only when it is really matters to you

- More you want, less you satisfy even though you get what you want.
- Negative or bad experience gives you lesson. Accept your mistakes and learn from it
- We always want a life without problems. That’s not possible. But you can solve the problems. You have to face the struggles to solve the problem. Solving the problems brings happiness (even in mathematics)
- The accurate measurement of self-worth is how a person feels about negative experience in a life.
- Ask yourself questions. Try to find out the true answer. Even though you’re right or wrong, just admit it. (both in personal and professional life)
- You are the responsible for your actions, beliefs and emotions.
